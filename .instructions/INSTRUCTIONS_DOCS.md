# Documentation

## README.md

* **Maintain** `README.md`:
  * If missing — create it.
  * If it exists — update it and keep it consistent with the current project state.

## Tools documentation (mandatory)

In `README.md`, maintain a dedicated section that lists:

* each tool used in the project,
* what it is used for,
* how to run it (exact commands / entry points),
* where outputs/artifacts go (e.g. `.temp/`, `diagrams/`, etc.).

---

## Unresolved questions

* If there are unresolved questions/decisions:
  * document them in `UNRESOLVED_QUESTIONS.md` and keep it up to date.

---

## Language

* All **public specs** must be written in **English**.
