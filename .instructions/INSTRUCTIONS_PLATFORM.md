# Platform

* Before building/testing, **inspect the project** to determine the intended target platform(s).
* If multiple platforms are supported, prefer **iOS** when available.
* If iOS is not available, build for the next most relevant supported platform (e.g. **macOS**, etc.).
* Do not build for unrelated platforms unless the project supports them or the task explicitly requires it.
