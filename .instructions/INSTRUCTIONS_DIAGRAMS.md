# Diagrams Rules

**Mandatory.**

## General

* Do not put "everything" into one diagram/file.
* Prefer multiple small, focused diagrams over one large unreadable diagram.
* Each diagram must have a clear title and narrow purpose.

## Tools & Patterns

For Structurizr DSL, PlantUML, and Graphviz patterns, folder structure, and rendering commands — follow the `architecture-diagrams` skill.
